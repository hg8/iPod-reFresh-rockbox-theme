**Description**:  
Thought of as a reFresh for the old official iPod theme, a modernized, latest iOS design inspired theme. As this is my first theme and encounter with SBS/WPS customization, I took inspiration (code, ideas and graphics) from some beautiful themes already available, and I thank the creators for their great work:
- iRB_Modern by I R D
- Nightpod by Christian Soffke
- FreshOS by c-yu (yuuiko)
